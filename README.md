This repository consists of the python script for detecting the number of faces in real time.


### System Overview 

The system consists of a python script that includes the necessary functions nedded to implement the face detection model with the use of exsiting Haarcascade algorithm along with its pre-trained dataset available at [this link](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml).
